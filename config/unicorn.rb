# Sample verbose configuration file for Unicorn (not Rack)
#
# This configuration file documents many features of Unicorn
# that may not be needed for some applications. See
# http://unicorn.bogomips.org/examples/unicorn.conf.minimal.rb
# for a much simpler configuration file.
#
# See http://unicorn.bogomips.org/Unicorn/Configurator.html for complete
# documentation.

# Use at least one worker per core if you're on a dedicated server,
# more will usually help for _short_ waits on databases/caches.

# Since Unicorn is never exposed to outside clients, it does not need to
# run on the standard HTTP port (80), there is no reason to start Unicorn
# as root unless it's from system init scripts.
# If running the master process as root and the workers as an unprivileged
# user, do this to switch euid/egid in the workers (also chowns logs):
# user "unprivileged_user", "unprivileged_group"

# Help ensure your application will always spawn in the symlinked
# "current" directory that Capistrano sets up.

  # When sent a USR2, Unicorn will suffix its pidfile with .oldbin and
  # immediately start loading up a new version of itself (loaded with a new
  # version of our app). When this new Unicorn is completely loaded
  # it will begin spawning workers. The first worker spawned will check to
  # see if an .oldbin pidfile exists. If so, this means we've just booted up
  # a new Unicorn and need to tell the old one that it can now die. To do so
  # we send it a QUIT.
  #
  # Using this method we get 0 downtime deploys.
